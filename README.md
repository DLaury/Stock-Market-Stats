# Stock-Market-Stats
This is an analysis utilizing visual basic within excel. I created a script that will do the following to all of the worksheets within the workbook:
- Grab each stocks ticker name and append a column
- Calculate yearly change from year open to year close and append a column
- Calculate percent change from year open to year close and append a column
- Calculate total volume and append a column
- Use conditional formatting to highlight positive change and negative change
- Calculate greatest percent increase and append a column
- Calculate greatest percent decrease and append a column
- Calculate greatest total volume and append a column

An example smaller sample size file is included in this repository with the vba applied for demonstration. Images of the complete file are also included.
